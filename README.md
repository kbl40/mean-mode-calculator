## Mean and Mode Calculator
This is a quick program from the Rust book that will take in five integers from the user and calculate the mean and the mode of the data.

From the terminal while in the root directory run:

`cargo run` 

The program will prompt the user five times to enter an integer. It will then output the mean and the mode of the data set.
